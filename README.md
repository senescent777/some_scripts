Some_scripts that i made for a certain purpose. 
During covid i had to find something to do. Recently i decided to show you "what i did last summer".

There is some remains of debug-clutter that have to be removed.  After that, this  should work, at least for me. I think i got the most of it.

Although, i will not give any guarantees. And if you choose to use this repository, the risk is 100% yours. Consider yourself warned.
