Some_scripts that i made for a certain purpose. Remastering Debian-based livecd:s, that is.

During covid i had to find something to do. And i kept going after that. Recently i decided to show the world "what i did last summer".

There may still be some debug-clutter left. So the scripts may not work perfectly.
But at least files under minimize work for me.

Although, i will not give any guarantees. 
And if you choose to use this repository, the risk is 100% yours. Consider yourself warned.
