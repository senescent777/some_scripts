Some_scripts that i made for a certain purpose. Remastering Debian-based livecd:s, that is.

During covid i had to find something to do. And i kept going after that. Recently i decided to show the world "what i did last summer".
There were unholy amounts of debug and commented rows so i had to grep out most of it. Now i think that i made the mutilated scripts work again, kind of.
